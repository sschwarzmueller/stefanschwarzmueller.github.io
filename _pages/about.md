My main research interest focusses on the structure-property relationship of solid-state materials. How do features related to the crystal structure like the size and arrangement of atom groups, channels, cages and distinct atomic positions influence the materials’ properties? How does the micro- and nanostructure (so called “real structure”) like grain size, pores, inclusions and precipitates help to optimize a material? In order to understand this structure-property relationship it is often crucial to investigate the materials’ structure or properties (thermal, ionic, electrical conductivity and so on) while an external stimulus like temperature or pressure is applied (so called in-situ measurements). This is somehow like being a detective chasing the next case; sometimes tedious, mostly exciting and in the end always satisfying the thirst for knowledge.
